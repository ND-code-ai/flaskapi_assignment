minikube start --driver=docker

# Create a persistent volume and persistent volume claim for MongoDB
kubectl apply -f mongo-deployment.yaml

# Build the Flask API Docker image and apply its deployment and service
docker build -t flask-api:latest .
kubectl apply -f flask-api-deployment.yaml

# Check the status of deployments
kubectl get pods

# Access the Flask API service
minikube service flask-api-service

# Stop Minikube when done
minikube stop


Note:
In the Flask API YAML file, a Persistent Volume Claim (flask-api-pvc) is defined, but you should adjust the storage class and other parameters according to your needs and the specifics of your Kubernetes cluster.
The MongoDB connection string in the Flask API (MONGO_URI) should point to the mongo service DNS name, as that's the hostname from the perspective of the Kubernetes cluster.
The Minikube start command uses the Docker driver; if you are using a different driver, adjust the command accordingly.
Please make sure to adjust the configurations, such as storage size and access modes, according to your specific requirements and Kubernetes cluster setup.
